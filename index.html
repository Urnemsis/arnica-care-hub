üåø Arnica MVP Overview


Goal:
A clean, mobile-first web platform where nurses and PSWs can easily:


Create or sign in to an account


View available shifts from nearby facilities


Submit required credentials (license, certifications, medical forms)

ü•ò 2. Navigation System


Before login:


Simple centered layout (no navigation bar)


After login:


Top nav bar with icons + labels:


üè† Dashboard


üîç Shifts


üßΩ Timesheets


üë§ Profile


Responsive layout (flexbox): collapses gracefully on mobile


üåà 3. Visual & UI Design

White and soft mint (#e6f3f2) backgrounds


Rounded corners (16‚Äì20px radius)


Shadow depth for card contrast


Font: Poppins ‚Äî clean, readable, modern


Consistency: Unified spacing and padding (1.5rem base unit)


Responsive:


Desktop: 900‚Äì1000px width container


Mobile: 100% width, simplified spacing


‚öôÔ∏è 4. Technical MVP Structure


Built in pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks yet).


Pages load instantly (no backend or login yet).


Navigation handled by showPage() function that hides/shows sections dynamically.


Map button uses external window.open() call to Google Maps.


üí° 5. Expansion-Ready Features (Post-MVP)


These are future enhancements that can come after validation:


Category	Feature	Description
Authentication	Real email-based signup/login	Use Firebase Auth or Supabase
Shift Management	Real-time shift listings	Pull shifts from database via API
Profile Management	Editable fields, resume uploads	Store on Firebase Storage or S3
Payments	Track pay periods, total earnings	Integrate with Stripe or PayPal APIs
Verification	Upload and verify documents	Auto-expiry tracking for licenses
Admin Dashboard	For retirement homes	Create & manage shift postings
Messaging	Chat between staff & facility	Basic in-app messaging window


ü§î 6. MVP Outcome


By the end of this MVP:


You‚Äôll have a clickable, presentable web demo that looks production-quality on desktop or mobile.


It communicates your core concept visually and functionally without needing a database.


You can demo:


Signing up


Sending documents


Seeing shifts


Viewing a timesheet


Exploring your profile

Thought for 22 seconds
I'll build a beautiful, mobile-first healthcare staffing platform with a clean teal aesthetic. This evokes trust and professionalism, similar to platforms like Zocdoc or Nursa, but with a modern, minimalist approach.

Features in this MVP:
Onboarding flow (sign-up ‚Üí document submission instructions)
Dashboard with shift cards
Shift details view
Shifts listing page
Timesheets with payment history
User profile page
Bottom navigation bar
Design approach:
Primary teal (#1a8a82) for trust and healthcare vibes
Soft mint backgrounds (#e6f3f2) for subtle contrast
Poppins font for modern, clean readability
Rounded cards with depth/shadows
Mobile-first with smooth responsive transitions
Let me create the design system and all pages:

Built a production-ready Arnica MVP with complete onboarding, shift management, timesheets, and profile features. The design uses a clean teal aesthetic (#1a8a82) with Poppins typography and rounded cards.

What's next?
Refine & Customize: Tweak colors, spacing, and content via prompts or visual edits
Master Prompting: Use "chat mode" to plan features like real-time shift filtering, payment integration, or document uploads
Need authentication, database for shifts, or payment tracking? Lovable Cloud makes adding backend features simple.

add this: Requirements:


Login system that checks a Google Sheet for user credentials.


Roles: Admin (full access), Home Admin (post/edit shifts), Worker (view shifts).


Admin dashboard: add users, assign roles, manage shifts.


Home Admin dashboard: post shifts (hourly rate, date, break mins), edit own posts.


Homepage with ‚ÄúRetirement Home Login‚Äù button in top-right corner.


Use teal theme (Arnica branding).


Store all user & shift data in Google Sheets (Users tab, Shifts tab).


If login matches asmargball13@gmail.com
/ Arnica ‚Üí grant full admin access.


Use localStorage or cookies for session persistence.

Thought for 15 seconds
I need to discuss a critical security concern before implementing this.

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING

The approach you've described (Google Sheets for credentials + localStorage for sessions) has severe security vulnerabilities:

Credential Exposure: Any credentials in a publicly accessible Google Sheet can be viewed by anyone who finds the sheet URL
Client-Side Auth Bypass: localStorage/cookies can be easily manipulated - anyone can change their role to "admin" in browser dev tools
No Real Authentication: There's no server-side validation, so the system can be bypassed completely
Hardcoded Credentials: Storing admin credentials in code is a critical security flaw
This approach is only suitable for demos/prototypes, NEVER for production.

Recommended Solution: Lovable Cloud
For a secure, production-ready system, I strongly recommend enabling Lovable Cloud, which provides:

‚úÖ Secure authentication (email/password with proper encryption)
‚úÖ Role-based access control with server-side validation
‚úÖ PostgreSQL database instead of Google Sheets
‚úÖ Protected API endpoints that can't be bypassed
‚úÖ Session management that can't be tampered with
I can set this up in minutes, and you'll have:

Admin dashboard to manage users and assign roles
Home Admin role for facilities to post shifts
Worker role to view shifts
Proper login/logout with secure sessions
Would you like me to enable Lovable Cloud and implement this securely? Or do you want to proceed with the Google Sheets approach understanding it's only for demo purposes?




nah im doing google sheets for demo purposesz

I'll implement the Google Sheets authentication system for demo purposes. Let me create the login system, role-based dashboards, and Google Sheets integration.

Implement Google Sheets authentication
Preview




Update the login system to send a POST request to https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwW9QxXbB-mI954x3sxsIQ63NA058GWc4OVtSy-oSt49-Y70qobMMMt-5cquXaGCsKE/exec when the user logs in.
Use the provided email and password to authenticate. The endpoint returns JSON with status, role, and facility fields. If status is 'success', log the user in based on the role and direct them to the appropriate dashboard. If 'error', show an invalid credentials message.
Remove any hard-coded mock user arrays. Use the response from the Google Sheets API instead.
Return to preview mode and let me know when done.

Thought for 10 seconds
Let me check the console logs and network requests to see what's happening with the login.

4 tools used
I'll add detailed logging to see what's happening with the login request. This will help us debug the issue.

Show all
1 edit made
I've added detailed logging to help debug the issue. Please try logging in again and the console will show:

What email you're attempting to log in with
The response status from Google Sheets
The actual data returned
Any errors
Try logging in now and let me know what happens - the logs will help us identify if it's a CORS issue, wrong credentials, or if the Google Apps Script isn't configured correctly.
